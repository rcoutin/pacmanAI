Pacman AI implementation, credit to Volkan IlBeyli for the PacMan clone base-> https://github.com/vilbeyli/Pacman

We have implemented artifcial intelligence strategies for an agent to play the popular game Pac-man. The game presents several high level AI challenges: navi- gating the map, gathering food (Pac-dots) to complete the level, evading the enemy characters (ghosts) in the map, and collecting power-ups to defeat the enemies. The AI agent needs to continuously evaluate and apply various decisions in order to survive and make meaningful progress in completing a level.
